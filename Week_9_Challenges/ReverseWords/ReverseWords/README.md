# Reverse Words

## Learning Competencies
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and hashes
- Create methods that take arguments to modify the output

## Summary:

In this challenge, you will need to write a method that takes a sentence as a string and reverses **each word** in the sentence. ie the order of the words remains

## Release 0: Write [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)
What are the steps that need to happen to take a string "Space Cadets Dice Duals" and turn it into "acepS stedaC eciD slauD"

## Release 1: Write your [initial solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)
Once you have stubbed out your method - uncomment the latter tests of the test file.
Once you write the solution, run the tests. If your initial solution passes all tests, move on to the next release.

## Release 2: Write Driver Code &/ Driver Test Code
Translate as much of the NInit as you can into [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md). Make sure your initial solution is passing all of your tests.

## Release 3: [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

## Release 4: Push!
