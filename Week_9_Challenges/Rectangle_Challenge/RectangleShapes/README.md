# Implement a Rectangle Class

## Learning Competencies
- Implement a basic C# class and identify when to use class instance variables
- Find and use .Net  methods to solve challenges
- Use strings, integers, arrays, Lists and Dictionaries

## Summary:
In this challenge, you will want to create four instance methodes for a rectangle:

- `Rectangle.Area`, which returns the area of the rectangle as an int
- `Rectangle.Perimeter`, which returns the perimeter of the rectangle as an int
- `Rectangle.Diagonal`, which returns the length of the rectangle's diagonal as a `Double`
- `Rectangle.IsSquare`, which returns a boolean

## Release 0: Write [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)
How are each of the methods going to work?

## Release 1: Stub out the Methods
Stub out all four methods so that the four initial tests pass.
Use "throw new NotImplementedException()" in place of code so that the tests compile and run.
Uncomment the remaining tests.

## Release 2: Write your [initial solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

Once you write the solution, run the tests. If your initial solution passes all tests, move on to the next release.

## Release 3: Translate NUnit
Translate as much of the NUnit tests as you can into [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md) in the Static Void Main of the Program Class of the Console App. Make sure your initial solution is passing all of your tests.

## Release 4: [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

## Release 4: Push!
